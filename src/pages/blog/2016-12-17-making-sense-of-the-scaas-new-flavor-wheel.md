The VW Group is racing towards electrification, and Audi is carving its own path for electric dominance in the premium sector.

But what is Ingolstadt doing exactly? How will Audi follow up the e-Tron, and what can we expect in the next few years? Keep reading for a round-up of everything EV from Audi.

# The electrification plan
Audi’s new push is to become a ‘new premium’ brand. Audi CEO Bram Schot told CAR at the 2019 Frankfurt motor show that the brand needs to answer customers’ demands by offering a more focused range of models. In an interview with car at Frankfurt, he stated that he would like 25% fewer model lines and variations as quickly as possible, which represents quite a shift in Audi’s philosophy.

Along with the culling of combustion engine product variants, Audi’s goal is to offer more than 30 electrified cars by 2025, with 20 being full BEVs. “We expect that 40% of all Audis sold by 2025 will be electrified. Next year, we will offer 12 EVs and seven plug-ins,’ Schot told us.
